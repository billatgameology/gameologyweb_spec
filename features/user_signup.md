Feature Specification: User Sign-Up (Version 1.0)
Document Version: 1.1 (Revised)

Date: October 3, 2025

Author: Project Lead

1. Overview & Goal
This document specifies the requirements for the user sign-up and registration process. The primary goal is to provide a secure, intuitive, and clear way for new users to create an account, which is required to interact with community features like commenting, posting on the forum, and submitting bug reports.

2. User-Facing Requirements
The sign-up process will be presented as a single form with the following fields:

Display Name:

Label: Display Name

Description: The public name that will be shown next to all your posts and comments.

Validation: * Required, must be between 3 and 20 characters long.

Uniqueness Check: Must be unique. When the user focuses away from this field, the system will immediately check if the name is already taken. If it is, a red error message ("Display name is taken, please pick another.") will appear below the field. This check repeats until a unique name is entered.

Email Address:

Label: Email

Description: Used for login and account management. Must be a valid email address.

Validation: Required, must be a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com).

Password:

Label: Password

Description: Your secret password for logging in.

Validation: Required, must be at least 6 characters long.

Confirm Password:

Label: Confirm Password

Description: Please enter your password again to confirm.

Validation: Required, must match the Password field exactly.

3. Best Practices & Functional Requirements
This section outlines the technical and user experience best practices that must be implemented.

3.1. Process Flow
User Fills Form: A user begins filling out the required fields.

Client-Side & Real-time Validation: * The form immediately checks for basic errors on input (e.g., empty fields, password length).

As specified above, the Display Name field performs an asynchronous check against the database on focus out to ensure the name is not already taken.

Client-side validation for mismatched passwords and invalid email format runs before submission.

User Submits Form: A user clicks "Sign Up."

Server-Side Creation (Firebase):

If client-side validation passes, the data is sent to Firebase Authentication.

Firebase checks if the email is already in use. If so, a clear error is returned to the user ("This email is already registered.").

If the email is unique, Firebase Authentication creates the new user account, securely hashing and salting the password. Passwords are never stored in plain text.

Firestore Document Creation:

Upon successful account creation in Firebase Auth, a new document must be created in the users collection in Firestore.

The document ID will be the user's new Firebase Auth uid.

The document will be populated with the displayName, email, a createdAt timestamp, and a default role of "user".

Post-Registration:

The user is automatically logged in.

The user is redirected to the website's homepage or a "Welcome" page.

3.2. Security & User Experience
Clear Error Messaging: All validation errors, both client-side and server-side, must be displayed in a clear and helpful manner. Avoid generic "An error occurred" messages.

Password Strength Indicator (Optional but Recommended): A visual indicator showing password strength (e.g., "Weak," "Medium," "Strong") as the user types can be helpful.

HTTPS: The entire sign-up process must be served over HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted in transit.

Data Handling: User data should only be used for the purposes outlined. No sensitive data should be logged or stored unnecessarily.

4. What is OUT OF SCOPE for Version 1.0
To ensure a focused initial release, the following will be deferred:

Social Sign-Up: No "Sign up with Google/Facebook/etc." options.

Email Verification: Users will not be required to verify their email address immediately after sign-up, but this is a high-priority feature for a future version.

"Forgot Password" Flow: This will be developed as a separate, subsequent feature.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): No multi-factor authentication will be implemented.

Profile Picture Upload: Users will manage their profile picture after registration, not during sign-up.
