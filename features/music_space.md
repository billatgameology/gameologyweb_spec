# Dedicated Music Space Specification

**Spec ID:** `FEAT-MUSIC-SPACE-001`  
**Version:** `3.0`  
**Status:** `Implemented - Production Ready`  
**Created:** `2025-09-26`  
**Last Updated:** `2025-09-28`  
**Author(s):** `Bill Wang`

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Users who enjoy the hero page's ambient music have no way to listen to the full 'Endless Drifting' album continuously in a dedicated, low-distraction environment. The experience lacks a deeper, meditative visual component to complement the audio, limiting its potential as a "chill space" for long-term focus or relaxation.

### Goals

**Primary Goal:** Provide a persistent, long-play audio experience where users can listen to the entire music albums on a continuous loop.

**Secondary Goal:** Create a "digital zen garden" or "chill" space on the site for users who want to relax or focus on other tasks with ambient background music.

**Tertiary Goal:** Enhance the starfield background with dynamic constellation animations, paired with uplifting messages that appear at regular 60-second intervals.

### Non-Goals

- **No complex playlist management:** This is not a full-featured music player. Users will not be able to create custom playlists, reorder tracks, or upload their own music.
- **No social features:** There will be no chat or user profiles.
- **No user interaction with animations:** The constellation animations are a passive visual experience.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

```
As a visitor,
I want to navigate to a dedicated music space,
So that I can listen to the full album without interruption for an extended period.
```

```
As a remote worker or student,
I want to open the music space in a browser tab,
So that I have calming background music and a gentle, visually interesting animation to help me focus or relax.
```

### Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

```
As a user,
When my internet connection drops temporarily,
The player should attempt to buffer and resume playback gracefully without losing my place,
So that my listening experience is not abruptly reset.
```

```
As a user,
When I navigate away from the music space,
The original website's background music should resume control,
So that the audio experience remains consistent across the site.
```

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |

## Design Specification

### User Interface

The UI will be a full-screen view of the StarFieldHero animated background, enhanced with automatic constellation formation cycles. Music controls will be presented as responsive overlays.

### Visual Design

**Background:** Reuse the StarFieldHero component's starfield animation system, including:
- Purple particle field with rotation
- Yellow star generation and connection mechanics
- Glassmorphic lore panel system
- Word-by-word text animation

**Controls:** 
- **Desktop:** Expandable/collapsible overlay with traditional music player interface
- **Mobile:** Bottom drawer that slides up for full controls, collapses to minimal "now playing" bar
- **Auto-collapse:** After inactivity timeout on mobile
- **Swipe gestures:** Up to expand, down to collapse on mobile

**Animation Sequence (Updated Implementation):**
1. **Starfield Base:** Purple particles with rotation (adapted from StarFieldHero)
2. **Star Appearance:** Golden stars appear in random positions (4-7 stars) - lore panel closes for clean transition
3. **Sequential Connection:** Stars connect in linear sequence using StarFieldHero algorithm
4. **3D Constellation Label:** Golden text sprite appears near the last star in the constellation, tracks with rotation in 3D space
5. **Lore Panel Display:** Fixed-size lore panel (500x200px) reopens at bottom center (10% from bottom) with word-by-word animation
6. **Persistent Display:** Both constellation label and lore panel remain visible throughout cycle
7. **Cycle Restart:** Lore panel closes and new constellation cycle begins automatically

### Technical Architecture

│   └── Persistent display (no constellation name header)
└── AudioManager (override site music, restore on exit)
```

### Music Integration

**Timing Logic (Updated):**
- Constellation cycles run independently of song timing
- Each cycle shows: star appearance → connection → labeling → persistent display
- New track selection triggers automatic music playback continuation
- Constellation label remains visible throughout entire cycle as 3D sprite
- Lore panel stays open until next constellation cycle begins
- Clean cycle restart generates new constellation with different star patterns

**Data Sources:**
- Music metadata: `/public/music/index.json` and `/public/music/{album-id}/metadata.json`
- Audio files: `/public/music/{album-id}/*.m4a`
- Constellation data: `constellations.json` (random selection from 1000+ entries)

### Interaction Design

**Entry Flow:**
1. User navigates to `/music-space`
2. Starfield loads immediately
3. Entry gate displays: "You have entered music space, click to enter"
4. User click triggers music start and constellation cycle
5. Defaults to first track of first album at 50% volume

**Audio Management:**
- Override any existing site background music on entry
- Restore original site audio control on navigation away
- Graceful buffering and resume for network interruptions

### Responsive Behavior

**Desktop:**
- Expandable/collapsible music control overlay
- Full traditional music player interface
- Hover states and smooth transitions

**Mobile:**
- Bottom drawer UI pattern
- Swipe gestures (up/down) for expand/collapse
- Auto-collapse after inactivity
- Touch-friendly control sizes
- Minimal "now playing" bar when collapsed

- **Connection Algorithm:** Sequential linear connections from StarFieldHero (ensures all stars connect)
- **Star Generation:** 4-7 stars per constellation with size variance (10% large, 30% medium, 60% normal)
- **Label System:** 3D sprites positioned relative to last star in constellation (not centered)
- **Label Positioning:** Offset above and to the right of the last star with rotation tracking
- **Lore Panel:** Fixed 500x200px dimensions at bottom 10% with persistent display
- **Phase Management:** Ref-based animation loops to prevent React re-render issues
- **Memory Management:** Proper Three.js object disposal and cleanup on constellation changes

## Key Architectural Improvements

- **Persistent Visual Elements:** Constellation labels remain visible throughout cycles
- **3D Scene Integration:** Labels track with last star position and rotate naturally with constellation in 3D space
- **Fixed Layout:** Lore panel maintains stable position during text animation
- **Seamless Transitions:** Clean constellation generation without duplicates or glitches
