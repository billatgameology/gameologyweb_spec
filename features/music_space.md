# Dedicated Music Space Specification

**Spec ID:** `FEAT-MUSIC-SPACE-001`  
**Version:** `1.1`  
**Status:** `Draft`  
**Created:** `2025-09-26`  
**Last Updated:** `2025-09-27`  
**Author(s):** `Bill Wang`

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Users who enjoy the hero page's ambient music have no way to listen to the full 'Endless Drifting' album continuously in a dedicated, low-distraction environment. The experience lacks a deeper, meditative visual component to complement the audio, limiting its potential as a "chill space" for long-term focus or relaxation.

### Goals

**Primary Goal:** Provide a persistent, long-play audio experience where users can listen to the entire music albums on a continuous loop.

**Secondary Goal:** Create a "digital zen garden" or "chill" space on the site for users who want to relax or focus on other tasks with ambient background music.

**Tertiary Goal:** Enhance the hero section with a dynamic animation of stars forming constellations, paired with uplifting messages that appear at regular intervals.

### Non-Goals

- **No complex playlist management:** This is not a full-featured music player. Users will not be able to create custom playlists, reorder tracks, or upload their own music.
- **No social features:** There will be no chat or user profiles.
- **No user interaction with animations:** The constellation animations are a passive visual experience.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

```
As a visitor,
I want to navigate to a dedicated music space,
So that I can listen to the full album without interruption for an extended period.
```

```
As a remote worker or student,
I want to open the music space in a browser tab,
So that I have calming background music and a gentle, visually interesting animation to help me focus or relax.
```

### Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

```
As a user,
When my internet connection drops temporarily,
The player should attempt to buffer and resume playback gracefully without losing my place,
So that my listening experience is not abruptly reset.
```

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| FR-01 | Continuous Playback | High | The full "Endless Drifting" album plays from the first to the last track and then loops back to the beginning automatically. |
| FR-02 | Persistent Audio Controls | High | User has access to controls for play/pause, next track, previous track, and volume adjustment. These controls are always visible. |
| FR-03 | Dedicated URL | High | The music space is accessible via a unique and easily shareable URL, e.g., /music-space. |
| FR-04 | Minimalist UI | High | The UI consists solely of the hero page visual background and the persistent audio control component. |
| FR-05 | Track Information Display | Medium | The name of the currently playing track is displayed within the audio control component. |
| FR-06 | Constellation Animation Cycle | High | The background animation follows a distinct, repeating cycle: 1. A new set of stars appears. 2. Stars begin to glow. 3. Lines connect the stars to form a constellation. 4. An uplifting message and the constellation name appear. 5. The message fades out. 6. The constellation and its name fade out, and the cycle repeats. |
| FR-07 | Dynamic Content Loading | High | The constellation data (star positions, connections) and associated messages are loaded from a data source, not hardcoded. |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Target | Measurement |
|----|-------------|--------|-------------|
| NFR-01 | Performance | Initial load < 2s. Animations must maintain a smooth framerate. | Lighthouse, Browser Performance Profiler |
| NFR-02 | Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA | Audio controls must be fully keyboard-navigable and screen-reader compatible. Uplifting messages must be legible with sufficient color contrast. |
| NFR-03 | Browser Support | Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge | Manual and automated cross-browser testing. |

## Design Specification

### User Interface

The UI will be a full-screen view of the existing hero page's animated starry background, which will now include a constellation animation cycle. A single, persistent audio control component will be overlaid at the bottom of the screen.

### Visual Design

- **Background:** Reuse the existing hero page background component, which will serve as the canvas for the new constellation animations.

- **Controls:** A minimalist, floating control bar with clean icons for play/pause, next, previous, and a volume slider. The current track title will be displayed.

- **Animation Sequence:**
  1. **Starfield Reset:** The background returns to a simple field of a few static yellow stars.
  2. **Glow and Connect:** The stars begin to glow brightly. Animated lines then draw between the stars one by one, forming the shape of a constellation.
  3. **Message Reveal:** An uplifting message and the name of the constellation fade in together.
  4. **Message Fade:** After a set delay, the uplifting message fades out, leaving only the constellation and its name.
  5. **Constellation Fade:** After another delay, the constellation and its name fade out, resetting the scene for the next cycle.

- **Responsive Behavior:** The control bar and any text will adapt to mobile screen sizes, ensuring controls are large enough for touch targets and text is readable.

### Interaction Design

- **On-Load:** Music begins playing automatically once the user interacts with the document (to comply with autoplay policies). The animation cycle starts immediately on load.
- **Controls:** Standard interactions for a media player. Clicking play/pause toggles the audio state. Next/previous skips tracks within the album playlist.

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All functional requirements are implemented and pass acceptance criteria.
- [ ] The music player correctly loops the full album.
- [ ] The constellation animation cycle works as specified and loops with new content.
- [ ] UI is responsive and functions correctly on mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Accessibility standards for media controls and text are met.
- [ ] The feature is live and accessible at the /music-space URL.


## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we display the full tracklist, or only the current song? (Decision: Start with current song only for minimalism).
- [ ] What is the ideal initial volume level? (Decision: Default to 50%).
- [ ] What should the timing/interval be for the animation cycle? (Decision: Target a 60-second cycle for each constellation).
