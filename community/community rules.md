This community is created from the ground up, not using any existing forum technology. I’m reinventing the wheel because I naively believe I can build a positive environment. Let’s all give it a shot. This may be controversial, but AI will be the moderator—reviewing every post. That’s the plan to handle counter‑productive posts.

Details below. 

# Community Guidelines

Goal: A constructive, fun, and supportive place to explore games, design ideas, strategy, tooling, feature requests, creative concepts, music in games, and even off‑topic discussions—while keeping things respectful and safe.

## TL;DR
- Minimal data; protect privacy.
- Attack ideas, not people.
- Strong language fine; harassment, hate, threats not.
- Bring reasons, not drive‑by dismissals.
- No gambling, sexual content, illegal or exploit (cheat/security) material.
- AI may hide posts; you can edit, appeal, or leave hidden.
- Proportional moderation; transparent process.


## 1. Data & Privacy
- Required to register: display name + email only.
- Email visible only to admins; never public.
- No selling or sharing of personal info.
- Do not post anyone’s personal data (no doxxing: real names, addresses, private accounts, financial or identifying info).
- You control what you share. You may request account/data removal (except what must be retained for legal/security reasons).

## 2. Respectful Conduct
Debate ideas, not people. Prohibited:
- Personal attacks, insults, harassment, slurs, hate or discrimination 
- Threats, intimidation, targeted pile‑ons
- Encouraging self‑harm

Examples:
- OK: “That approach underperforms because it stalls mid‑progression.”
- Not OK: “You’re an idiot for using that.”

## 3. Language
Strong / mature language is allowed when not used to target or demean a person or group.
- OK: “This build fucking slaps.”
- Not OK: “You useless piece of trash.”

## 4. Scope of Topics
Allowed: things related to this website use, feature requests, game ideas, music ideas, strategy breakdowns, tooling thoughts, and honestly anything constructive or off‑topic that still respects the rules.

## 5. Quality of Debate
Heated discussion is great; it makes us better—maybe even changes minds.
- “That’s stupid” alone: not OK.
- “That’s weak because it sacrifices tempo for no payoff”: OK.
Upgrade dismissals into arguments with evidence, examples, or data.

## 6. Restricted Content
Not allowed:
- Gambling promotion/facilitation
- Sexual or explicit adult content
- Illegal content or instructions

## 7. AI Moderation Flow
- New or edited posts may be auto‑scanned.
- If flagged: only you + moderators can see it (soft‑hidden).
Your options:
1. Edit & resubmit (re‑check runs)
2. Delete
3. Leave it (it stays hidden)
4. Request human review (appeal channel/email)
No strike/ban system yet; repeated abuse may trigger temporary posting cooldowns to protect the space.

## 8. Updates
Rules may evolve. Major changes will be announced with a dated changelog. Continued use = acceptance.
