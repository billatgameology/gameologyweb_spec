# Community Guidelines

This community is created from the ground up, not using any existing forum technology. I’m reinventing the wheel because I naively believe I can build a positive environment. Let’s all give it a shot. This may be controversial, but AI will be the moderator—reviewing every post. That’s the plan to handle counter‑productive posts.

# What is this community for: 
1. Tell me your ideas: it's much easier to build small games nowadays, so simple games can be built and playable within a week. The focus of the games types are simple rules, dynamic content, multiplayer or single player. It doesn't have to be a full game idea, could be features that can be added on to existing games. Anything you think that could improve the website.

2. Tell me what's broken. Bug reports. 

3. Share development experiences. I figure out how to do almost everything with support of content creators on the internet. I hope to give back by sharing anything I find useful. If you are curious about how I built anything on this website, ask away. 

4. Share things you find delightful. I have no targeted audience. Hopefully this website evolves and grows into some form if identity that is positive and supportive to people. 

5. Talk about games, art, XR, AI. These are top of my mind right now and will be my focus to build in these areas. 

# Rules

## 1. Respectful Conduct
Debate ideas, not people. Prohibited personal attacks, insults, harassment, slurs, hate or discrimination 

Examples:
- OK: "That approach underperforms because it stalls mid‑progression."
- Not OK: "You're an idiot for using that."

## 2. Language
Strong / mature language is allowed when not used to target or demean a person or group.
- OK: "You're the shit."
- Not OK: "You're shit." 
I cross my figners and hope LLM catching the difference. If not, you can request for human review. 

## 3. Quality of Debate
Heated discussion is great; it makes us better—maybe even changes minds.
Upgrade dismissals into arguments with evidence, examples, or data.
- "That's stupid" alone: not OK.
- "That's stupid because it sacrifices time for no payoff": OK.

## 4. Restricted Content
Not allowed:
- Gambling promotion/facilitation
- Sexual or explicit adult content
- Illegal content
- Ads or promotion of product without being asked. 

## 5. AI Moderation Flow
- New or edited posts will be auto‑scanned.
- If flagged: only you + moderators can see it (soft‑hidden).
Your options:
    1. Edit & resubmit (re‑check runs)
    2. Delete
    3. Leave it (it stays hidden)
    4. Request human review (appeal channel/email)
    
    No strike/ban system; If you lost your temper and got flagged, no worries, nobody will see the posts that are flagged. 
    
    Whenever you're ready, you can post again.


## 6. Updates
Rules may evolve. Continued use = acceptance.
