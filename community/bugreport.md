# Bug Reports (Version 1.0)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Author:** Project Lead

---

## 1. Overview & Goal
This document specifies the requirements for a new Bug Report feature. The goal is to provide a structured and transparent channel for authenticated users to report issues, glitches, or errors they encounter on the website. This will help administrators efficiently track, prioritize, and resolve bugs, ultimately improving the user experience.

This initial version (v1.0) focuses on the core functionality of submitting, viewing, and commenting on bug reports.

## 2. Key Terminology & Definitions

- **Bug Report:** A single, structured post submitted by a user detailing a specific issue.
- **Reporter:** An authenticated user who creates and submits a Bug Report.
- **Status:** A label assigned by a Site Administrator to indicate the current state of a Bug Report (e.g., "New," "Acknowledged," "In Progress," "Resolved," "Closed").
- **Comment:** A text-based response on a Bug Report, used for discussion, clarification, or updates from users and administrators.

## 3. Core Functions & Scope

The following functions are considered **IN SCOPE** for Version 1.0 of this feature.

### 3.1. Creating a Bug Report

- **Action:** Any authenticated user can create a new Bug Report.
- **Interface:** community page, bug report section.
- **Required Fields:**
  - **Title:** A concise, clear summary of the bug.
  - **Description:** A detailed explanation of the issue. A template encouraging users to provide steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior is recommended.
- **Process:** Upon submission, the report is publicly visible on the main Bug Reports page with a default status of "New."

### 3.3. Managing & Interacting with Bug Reports

**User Management:**
- A Reporter can edit the Title and Description of their own bug report to add clarifications.
- A Reporter can delete their own report similar to devlog comments. 
- Any authenticated user can add comments to any bug report.

**Admin Management:**
- Only a Site Administrator can change the Status of a Bug Report.
- Administrators can post official comments to ask for more information or provide updates on the resolution progress.

## 5. Assumptions
- A robust user authentication system (account creation, login, logout) already exists and is functional.
- Every user has a unique ID and a publicly visible "Display Name."
- There is a clear, backend distinction between a standard user and a Site Administrator for managing report statuses.
