Feature Specification: Bug Reports (Version 1.0)
Document Version: 1.0

Date: October 3, 2025

Author: Project Lead

1. Overview & Goal
This document specifies the requirements for a new Bug Report feature. The goal is to provide a structured and transparent channel for authenticated users to report issues, glitches, or errors they encounter on the website. This will help administrators efficiently track, prioritize, and resolve bugs, ultimately improving the user experience.

This initial version (v1.0) focuses on the core functionality of submitting, viewing, and commenting on bug reports.

2. Key Terminology & Definitions
Bug Report: A single, structured post submitted by a user detailing a specific issue.

Reporter: An authenticated user who creates and submits a Bug Report.

Status: A label assigned by a Site Administrator to indicate the current state of a Bug Report (e.g., "New," "Acknowledged," "In Progress," "Resolved," "Closed").

Comment: A text-based response on a Bug Report, used for discussion, clarification, or updates from users and administrators.

3. Core Functions & Scope
The following functions are considered IN SCOPE for Version 1.0 of this feature.

3.1. Creating a Bug Report
Action: Any authenticated user can create a new Bug Report.

Interface: A dedicated submission form (/bugs/new).

Required Fields:

Title: A concise, clear summary of the bug.

Description: A detailed explanation of the issue. A template encouraging users to provide steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior is recommended.

Affected Area: A dropdown or selectable list of predefined sections of the website (e.g., "Game A," "Forum," "User Accounts," "Devlogs").

Process: Upon submission, the report is publicly visible on the main Bug Reports page with a default status of "New."

3.2. Viewing Bug Reports
Main View:

A central page (/bugs) will list all submitted Bug Reports.

The list will display each report's Title, Reporter, Submission Date, and current Status.

The list should be filterable by Status.

Detailed View:

Clicking on a report from the main view navigates to a dedicated page for that report.

This view displays all the details submitted by the reporter.

It prominently shows the current Status of the report.

A comment section is available below the report details for discussion.

3.3. Managing & Interacting with Bug Reports
User Management:

A Reporter can edit the Title and Description of their own bug report to add clarifications.

A Reporter cannot delete their own report to maintain a historical record.

Any authenticated user can add comments to any bug report.

Admin Management:

Only a Site Administrator can change the Status of a Bug Report.

Administrators can post official comments to ask for more information or provide updates on the resolution progress.

4. What is OUT OF SCOPE for Version 1.0
To ensure a focused and timely initial release, the following features will be deferred to a future version:

Image/Video Uploads: Users cannot directly upload screenshots or screen recordings but can link to externally hosted media in the description.

Priority Levels: No system for setting bug priority (e.g., "Low," "Critical").

Assigning Reports: No functionality to assign a bug report to a specific developer or admin.

Voting System: Users cannot "upvote" bugs to signal their importance.

Private Reports: All submitted bug reports will be publicly visible.

Duplicate Detection: No automated system to detect or link duplicate bug reports.

5. Assumptions
A robust user authentication system (account creation, login, logout) already exists and is functional.

Every user has a unique ID and a publicly visible "Display Name."

There is a clear, backend distinction between a standard user and a Site Administrator for managing report statuses.
