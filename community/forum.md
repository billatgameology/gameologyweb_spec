Feature Specification: Community Forum (Version 1.0)
Document Version: 1.0

Date: October 3, 2025

Author: Project Lead

1. Overview & Goal
This document specifies the requirements for a new Community Forum feature. The primary goal is to create a space where users can connect, hold discussions, ask questions, and share knowledge with each other. This feature will empower users to create their own content and build a self-sustaining community around the website's games and development topics.

This initial version (v1.0) focuses on the foundational structure of a traditional forum: categories, topics (threads), and posts (replies).

2. Key Terminology & Definitions
Forum: The top-level container for all community discussions.

Category: A high-level section created by an administrator to organize the forum (e.g., "General Discussion," "Game Feedback," "Bug Reports").

Topic (Thread): A single, user-initiated conversation within a Category. A Topic consists of an initial post and all subsequent replies to it.

Post (Reply): A single entry within a Topic, submitted by a user. The first post creates the Topic, and all subsequent entries are replies.

User: Any authenticated user who can participate in the forum.

3. Core Functions & Scope
The following functions are considered IN SCOPE for Version 1.0 of this feature.

3.1. Forum Structure & Navigation
Category View: A main forum page (/forum) will display a list of all available Categories, along with a brief description for each.

Topic View: Clicking on a Category will navigate the user to a page listing all Topics within that category. Topics will be listed with their title, author, reply count, and the time of the last reply. The list will be sorted to show topics with the most recent activity first.

Post View: Clicking on a Topic will navigate the user to a page displaying the original post and all subsequent replies in chronological order.

3.2. User-Generated Content Creation
Creating a Topic:

Authenticated users can create a new Topic in any existing Category.

The creation form will require a Topic Title and the content for the first post.

Creating a Post (Replying):

Authenticated users can post a reply to any existing Topic.

The reply form will be a simple text area at the bottom of the Post View page.

3.3. Content Management (By Users)
Ownership: Users can only manage content they have created.

Editing Posts: Users can edit the content of their own posts (both initial posts of a topic and replies). An "(edited)" timestamp should be displayed.

Deleting Posts: Users can delete their own replies. A confirmation prompt is required.

Deleting Topics: A user can delete a Topic they created. This action will delete the initial post and all subsequent replies from other users within that topic. A clear warning and confirmation prompt are required for this action.

4. What is OUT OF SCOPE for Version 1.0
To ensure a focused and timely initial release, the following features will be deferred to a future version:

User Profiles & Signatures: No detailed user profiles or customizable forum signatures.

Private Messaging: No direct user-to-user messaging.

Likes, Reactions, or Upvotes: No system for rating posts or topics.

Image & Media Uploads: All content will be text-only.

Advanced Admin/Moderation Tools: No tools for moderators to pin/lock topics, ban users, or edit user posts.

Forum Search: No functionality to search for topics or posts.

User @Mentions & Notifications: Users will not be able to tag or notify each other.

5. Assumptions
A robust user authentication system (account creation, login, logout) already exists and is functional.

Every user has a unique ID and a publicly visible "Display Name."

Forum Categories will be created and managed by a Site Administrator through a separate process (e.g., directly in the database). There will be no user interface for category creation.
